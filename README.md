# Fall-From-Height
This repository contains a valid skeletal multibody model imported to Matlab/Simscape from a valid OpenSim model[1]. This model has been developed in Matlab2025/b.To refer to this  work cite [2].
# How to use Simscape Model
-  Download "Fullbody_OpensimModel_in_Simscape.slx".
-  Download "obj" folder.
-  Set the path of "obj" folder in Simulink's blocks.
